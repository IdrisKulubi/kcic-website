# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive multi-language support (internationalization/i18n) for the KCIC website. The system currently has a basic i18n infrastructure with English and French translations. This feature will complete the implementation by ensuring all UI components, pages, and user-facing content support both English and French languages with proper language switching, routing, and content management.

## Glossary

- **I18n System**: The internationalization system that manages translations, locale detection, and language switching
- **Locale**: A language code (en for English, fr for French) that identifies the user's language preference
- **Translation Key**: A dot-notation string path used to retrieve translated text from JSON files
- **Language Switcher**: A UI component that allows users to change the interface language
- **Locale Route**: A URL path prefixed with a locale code (e.g., /fr/about) for language-specific content
- **Translation File**: A JSON file containing key-value pairs of translation strings for a specific locale
- **Fallback Language**: The default language (English) used when a translation is missing in the selected locale

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to view the website in my preferred language (English or French), so that I can understand the content in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the I18n System detects the user's browser language preference, THE I18n System SHALL set the initial locale to French if the browser language is French, otherwise English
2. WHEN a user navigates to a Locale Route with a language prefix, THE I18n System SHALL display all content in the specified locale
3. WHEN a Translation Key is requested for the current locale, THE I18n System SHALL return the translated text from the corresponding Translation File
4. IF a Translation Key is missing in the selected locale's Translation File, THEN THE I18n System SHALL return the translation from the Fallback Language
5. THE I18n System SHALL persist the user's language preference across page navigations within the same session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to easily switch between English and French, so that I can read content in either language at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Language Switcher SHALL display both English and French language options with their respective flags or labels
2. WHEN a user clicks a language option in the Language Switcher, THE I18n System SHALL update the current locale to the selected language within 500 milliseconds
3. WHEN the locale changes, THE I18n System SHALL update the URL to include the new locale prefix while preserving the current page path
4. WHEN the locale changes, THE I18n System SHALL reload all visible translated content without requiring a full page refresh
5. THE Language Switcher SHALL visually indicate the currently active language

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all UI components to support both English and French translations, so that the entire user experience is localized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE I18n System SHALL provide translations for all navigation menu items in both English and French

3. THE I18n System SHALL provide translations for all static page content including hero sections, feature descriptions, and footer content in both English and French
4. THE I18n System SHALL provide translations for all error messages, validation messages, and system notifications in both English and French
5. WHEN a component renders, THE I18n System SHALL apply the correct translation based on the current locale

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable translation management system, so that I can easily add, update, and organize translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE I18n System SHALL store all translations in structured JSON Translation Files organized by locale
2. THE I18n System SHALL support nested translation keys using dot notation for logical grouping
3. THE I18n System SHALL support variable interpolation in translation strings using double curly braces syntax
4. THE I18n System SHALL cache loaded Translation Files to minimize file system access and improve performance
5. THE I18n System SHALL log warnings when Translation Keys are missing from Translation Files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want dates, numbers, and currency to be formatted according to my selected language's conventions, so that information is presented in a familiar format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a date, THE I18n System SHALL format the date according to the current locale's conventions
2. WHEN displaying a number, THE I18n System SHALL format the number using the current locale's number formatting rules
3. WHEN displaying currency amounts, THE I18n System SHALL format the currency using the current locale's currency formatting conventions
4. THE I18n System SHALL use the browser's Intl API for locale-specific formatting
5. THE I18n System SHALL handle timezone conversions appropriately for the current locale

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the website's metadata and SEO elements to reflect my selected language, so that search engines can properly index localized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads, THE I18n System SHALL set the HTML lang attribute to the current locale code
2. WHEN a page loads, THE I18n System SHALL include hreflang meta tags for all available language versions

5. THE I18n System SHALL provide locale-specific page titles and meta descriptions

### Requirement 7

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Language Switcher SHALL be keyboard navigable using Tab and Enter keys
2. THE Language Switcher SHALL announce the current language and available options to screen readers
3. WHEN the locale changes, THE I18n System SHALL announce the language change to screen readers
